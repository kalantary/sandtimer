### Features

- The sand in the hourglass changes colour based on the remaining time.
This is so a child who doesn't understand numbers can get an idea of how long they have to wait.

- The user has to enter a random 4 digit code to set or pause the timer
This is so the child cannot change the timer while waiting

- Shows an Image of what the timer is for
